# ✅ Phase 3: Matrix System - COMPLETE

## 📦 What Was Built

### Backend:
- **matrixService.js** - Core pyramid matrix logic with spillover

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Matrix Configuration:
```javascript
feeder: 2x2 (6 slots) → $1.5 per slot
bronze: 2x3 (14 slots) → $4.8 per slot  
silver: 2x3 (14 slots) → $30 per slot
gold: 2x3 (14 slots) → $150 per slot
diamond: 2x3 (14 slots) → $750 per slot
infinity: 2x3 (14 slots) → $15,000 per slot
```

### Spillover Algorithm:
- Finds next available position (L, R, LL, LR, RL, RR, etc.)
- Left-to-right, depth-first placement
- Tracks position path in database

### Auto-Progression:
- Monitors matrix completion
- Auto-upgrades: feeder → bronze → silver → gold → diamond → infinity
- Creates new stage_matrix entry on upgrade

### Earnings:
- Credits sponsor on each slot fill
- Updates wallet + transactions
- Records referral_earnings

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User deposits $18k → Moves to feeder
2. User refers someone → Matrix service places them
3. If user has < 2 direct slots → Place directly
4. If user has 2 direct slots → Spillover to downline
5. On each placement → Sponsor earns commission
6. When matrix fills (6 or 14 slots) → Auto-upgrade to next stage

## 📝 Next Steps

**Phase 4**: Frontend pyramid tree visualization
**Phase 5**: Earnings calculation updates
**Phase 6**: Admin panel enhancements
