🔹 Product Purchase Requirement

From the web content doc:

A new member must buy products worth ₦9,000 and pay a ₦9,000 registration fee.

Total entry cost = ₦18,000

.

So product purchase is mandatory at signup.

🔹 Should It Be Tracked as Separate Orders?

Yes ✅

The ₦9,000 product purchase is tied to actual goods (powders, teas, juices, etc.).

It should be logged as a separate order in the system, not just bundled into “registration.”

This way:

Inventory and stock movement can be tracked.

Users receive actual products (fulfilling the retail side of the MLM).

Compliance with consumer protection/anti-pyramid regulations is easier to show (since members aren’t just “buying positions,” they’re buying real products).

🔹 Do Users Select Products or Is It a Package Deal?

The documents don’t explicitly say “package deal.” But here’s the logic:

The Products Page lists multiple items with prices (teas, powders, juices, blends)

Since it says “members must buy products worth ₦9,000”, it strongly implies user choice, not a fixed pack.





Treat the ₦9,000 as a product order transaction.

Give
Custom Order (up to ₦9,000 minimum) → members pick products themselves.

The ₦9,000 registration fee should remain separate (not tied to products).
