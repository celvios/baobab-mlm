Feeder Stage (2x2 Matrix)

Structure: 2 levels, 2 people on the first level â†’ total 6 people in the matrix.

You earn $1.5 per person that joins under you (direct or spillover).

Once your 2x2 (6 slots) is complete, you progress to Bronze

.

ðŸ”¹ Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold â†’ Diamond (2x3 Matrix Stages)

From Bronze onward, the structure switches to a 2x3 matrix:

2 frontlines, each with 2, and each of those with 2 â†’ total 14 people required to complete the stage.

Payout per referral increases at each level:

Bronze: $4.8 Ã— 14 = $67.2

Silver: $30 Ã— 14 = $420

Gold: $150 Ã— 14 = $2,100

Diamond: $750 Ã— 14 = $10,500

Each stage also comes with incentives (gadgets, trips, cars, etc.), as listed in the document

Once your 2x3 matrix is fully filled (14 people) at a stage, you automatically move to the next stage.

ðŸ”¹ Infinity Stage

After completing Diamond, you enter Infinity where you earn $15,000 per person indefinitely on your matrix

âœ… Key Point: What Triggers Progression?

Progression is NOT based on total personal referrals.
It is based on matrix completion:

Feeder (2x2, 6 people) must be filled to move to Bronze.

Bronze/Silver/Gold/Diamond (2x3, 14 people) must be filled to move up.

Your direct referrals help, but spillover from uplines also fills your matrix.

So a user moves Feeder â†’ Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold â†’ Diamond only when their matrix for that stage is completed.
