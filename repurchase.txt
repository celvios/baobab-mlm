🎯 Purpose of Repurchase

The repurchase system ensures that members continuously buy products as they progress through the MLM stages. It prevents the system from relying solely on new registrations and ties earnings to real product sales.

🔹 1. Initial Joining Requirement

₦18,000 total:

₦9,000 registration fee (one-time only).

₦9,000 product purchase (starter pack or custom order).

Registration fee and product purchase must be tracked separately in the database.

🔹 2. Repurchase Triggers

Repurchase is not monthly by default.

Repurchase is triggered whenever:

A member completes a matrix stage (Feeder → Bronze → Silver → Gold → Diamond).

Or when admin sets “repurchase required before payout”.

This ensures members cannot withdraw earnings without making the required repurchase.

🔹 3. Repurchase Deductions

At each stage, part of the payout is deducted automatically for repurchase.

Example from Feeder Stage (2x2):

Company deducts ₦4,500 (₦1,500 + ₦3,000) before finalizing payouts

Baobab Export MLM Structure 2025

.

These deductions align with the repurchase product table:

Product	Initial Cost	Repurchase Cost
Powders	₦3,000	₦6,000
Lipgloss	₦6,000	₦12,000
Soap	₦4,000	₦6,000
Facial Oil	₦4,000	₦6,000
🔹 4. System Logic

At signup:

Store registration_fee = 9000 (one-time).

Store product_purchase = 9000 (starter pack or custom selection).

On stage completion:

Check if repurchase_made == true.

If not, auto-deduct repurchase amount from payout OR block withdrawal until repurchase order is placed.

Log repurchase as a new product order in the system.

On payout:

payout_amount = gross_stage_income – repurchase_cost.

Display both values in member dashboard (so they see deductions clearly).

🔹 5. Admin Controls

Admin should be able to:

Set repurchase requirement per stage (default: from PDF values).

See which members are pending repurchase before releasing payouts.

Approve or reject repurchase orders.

🔹 6. Member Dashboard UX

Show wallet balance (gross) and withdrawable balance (net after repurchase).

Add a “Repurchase Required” notification when a member reaches payout stage.

Allow member to choose which products to repurchase (or auto-assign default repurchase pack worth required amount).

✅ In short:

₦9k registration fee = one-time only.

₦9k product = at signup.

Repurchase = required at every stage cycle or before payouts.

Must be tracked as real product orders, not just deduction
