# MLM Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Database Tables (NEW)
**File:** `backend/database/mlm-tables.sql`
- `mlm_matrix` - Tracks user positions in the matrix tree
- `referral_earnings` - Records earnings per person placed in matrix
- `level_progressions` - Tracks stage completions and progressions
- `stage_matrix` - Tracks slots filled per stage (6 for Feeder, 14 for others)

#### 2. MLM Service (REWRITTEN)
**File:** `src/services/mlmService.js`

**Key Changes:**
- Fixed progression logic: Now based on **per-stage completion** (6 slots for Feeder, 14 for Bronze/Silver/Gold/Diamond)
- Added `initializeUser()` - Sets up new user in Feeder stage
- Added `placeUserInMatrix()` - Places user in sponsor's matrix with spillover
- Added `findPlacementPosition()` - Finds next available position (spillover logic)
- Added `payUpline()` - Pays bonus to upline when someone joins their matrix
- Added `completeStage()` - Handles stage completion and auto-progression
- Added `getStageProgress()` - Returns current stage progress (slots filled/required)

**Old Logic (WRONG):**
- Feeder → Bronze: 6 total referrals
- Bronze → Silver: 20 total referrals (cumulative)
- Silver → Gold: 34 total referrals (cumulative)

**New Logic (CORRECT):**
- Feeder: Fill 6 slots → Bronze
- Bronze: Fill 14 slots → Silver
- Silver: Fill 14 slots → Gold
- Gold: Fill 14 slots → Diamond
- Diamond: Fill 14 slots → Infinity

#### 3. Payment Controller (UPDATED)
**File:** `backend/src/controllers/paymentController.js`

**Changes:**
- When admin confirms joining fee payment:
  - Sets user to 'feeder' stage
  - Calls `mlmService.initializeUser()`
  - Calls `mlmService.placeUserInMatrix()` to place in sponsor's matrix
  - Triggers upline earnings

#### 4. MLM Controller (UPDATED)
**File:** `src/controllers/mlmController.js`

**Changes:**
- `getLevelProgress()` now uses `mlmService.getStageProgress()`
- Returns: currentStage, nextStage, slotsFilled, slotsRequired, progress%, bonusPerPerson

### Frontend Changes Needed

#### 1. Dashboard.js
**Current:** Shows cumulative referral count
**Needed:** Show stage-specific progress

```javascript
// Add to fetchDashboardData():
const stageProgress = await apiService.getStageProgress();
setStageProgress(stageProgress);

// Display:
<div>
  <p>Stage: {stageProgress.currentStage}</p>
  <p>Progress: {stageProgress.slotsFilled}/{stageProgress.slotsRequired}</p>
  <p>Next Stage: {stageProgress.nextStage}</p>
  <div className="w-full bg-gray-200 rounded-full h-2">
    <div 
      className="bg-green-600 h-2 rounded-full" 
      style={{width: `${stageProgress.progress}%`}}
    />
  </div>
</div>
```

#### 2. RankingsEarnings.js
**Current:** Shows total earnings
**Needed:** Show earnings breakdown by stage

```javascript
// Fetch earnings by stage
const earnings = await apiService.getEarnings();

// Display:
earnings.map(stage => (
  <div key={stage.stage}>
    <p>{stage.stage.toUpperCase()}</p>
    <p>{stage.people_count} people × ${STAGES[stage.stage].bonus}</p>
    <p>Total: ${stage.total_earned}</p>
  </div>
))
```

#### 3. Team.js / TeamTree.js
**Current:** Shows flat list of referrals
**Needed:** Show matrix structure (2x2 for Feeder, 2x3 for others)

```javascript
// Fetch matrix data
const matrix = await apiService.getUserMatrix();

// Display as tree:
// Level 1: 2 positions
// Level 2: 4 positions (for 2x2) or 6 positions (for 2x3)
```

## How It Works Now

### User Journey:

1. **Registration**
   - User registers with referral code
   - Email verification required
   - User is in "no_stage" (not active yet)

2. **Payment Confirmation**
   - User uploads payment proof (₦18,000)
   - Admin confirms payment
   - **TRIGGERS:**
     - User set to "feeder" stage
     - `stage_matrix` record created (0/6 slots)
     - User placed in sponsor's matrix
     - Sponsor earns $1.50

3. **Matrix Filling**
   - As more people join under sponsor:
     - Each person fills 1 slot
     - Sponsor earns $1.50 per person
     - Spillover: If sponsor's matrix is full, new users go to next available position

4. **Stage Completion**
   - When 6 slots filled in Feeder:
     - Auto-progress to Bronze
     - New `stage_matrix` record (0/14 slots)
     - Now earns $4.80 per person
   - When 14 slots filled in Bronze:
     - Auto-progress to Silver
     - Now earns $30 per person
   - And so on...

### Earnings Per Stage:

| Stage | Slots | Per Person | Total Earnings |
|-------|-------|------------|----------------|
| Feeder | 6 | $1.50 | $9 |
| Bronze | 14 | $4.80 | $67.20 |
| Silver | 14 | $30 | $420 |
| Gold | 14 | $150 | $2,100 |
| Diamond | 14 | $750 | $10,500 |
| Infinity | ∞ | $15,000 | Unlimited |

## Migration Steps

1. **Run Database Migration:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node run-mlm-migration.js
   ```

2. **Update Frontend API Calls:**
   - Add `getStageProgress()` to api service
   - Update Dashboard to show stage progress
   - Update Team page to show matrix structure

3. **Test Flow:**
   - Register new user with referral code
   - Upload payment proof
   - Admin confirms payment
   - Check if user is placed in matrix
   - Check if sponsor receives $1.50
   - Repeat 6 times to test stage progression

## API Endpoints

### Existing (Updated):
- `GET /api/mlm/progress` - Returns stage progress (slotsFilled/slotsRequired)
- `GET /api/mlm/earnings` - Returns earnings by stage
- `GET /api/mlm/matrix` - Returns matrix members
- `GET /api/mlm/team` - Returns direct referrals

### Frontend API Service Needed:
```javascript
// Add to src/services/api.js
getStageProgress: () => api.get('/mlm/progress'),
```

## Key Differences from Old Implementation

| Aspect | Old (Wrong) | New (Correct) |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Progression | Cumulative referrals | Per-stage completion |
| Feeder → Bronze | 6 total | 6 in Feeder matrix |
| Bronze → Silver | 20 total | 14 in Bronze matrix |
| Earnings | Only direct referrals | Direct + spillover |
| Matrix | Not functional | Full 2x2/2x3 structure |

## What Still Needs Frontend Work

1. **Dashboard.js** - Show stage progress bar
2. **RankingsEarnings.js** - Show stage-based earnings breakdown
3. **Team.js** - Show matrix visualization (2x2 or 2x3 grid)
4. **TeamTree.js** - Show tree structure with spillover
5. **API Service** - Add `getStageProgress()` method
