# MLM Spillover System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented proper matrix spillover logic where users progress based on matrix completion (including spillover from uplines), not just personal referrals.

## Key Changes

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **mlmService.js** - Core Spillover Logic

**New Method: `placeInMatrixWithSpillover()`**
- Finds available slots in the matrix tree using breadth-first search
- Places new users in the first available position (not just under direct referrer)
- Credits all uplines in the matrix path

**New Method: `findAvailableMatrixSlot()`**
- Searches the entire matrix tree for empty slots
- Ensures proper spillover placement

**New Method: `creditUplineChain()`**
- Walks up the matrix tree from placement position
- Credits every upline user whose matrix gets filled
- Updates `slots_filled` for all uplines
- Triggers auto-progression when matrix completes

**New Method: `getFullMatrixTree()`**
- Builds complete matrix tree recursively
- Shows all downlines including spillover

**New Method: `buildMatrixNode()`**
- Recursively builds tree structure
- Limits depth to prevent infinite loops

#### 2. **mlmController.js**

**New Endpoint: `getMatrixTree()`**
- Returns full matrix tree with spillover visualization
- Route: `GET /api/mlm/matrix-tree`

#### 3. **mlm.js** (Routes)
- Added new route for matrix tree endpoint

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **api.js**
- Added `getMatrixTree()` method to fetch spillover data

#### 2. **Team.js**
- Added progress bar showing matrix completion percentage
- Visual indicator of slots filled vs required

#### 3. **TeamTree.js**
- Updated to use new `getMatrixTree()` endpoint
- Now shows true matrix structure with spillover

## How Spillover Works Now

### Example Scenario:

```
User A (Feeder 0/6)
  ├─ User B (direct referral) → A: 1/6
  └─ User C (direct referral) → A: 2/6
      ├─ User D (C's referral) → A: 3/6 ✅ SPILLOVER
      │   ├─ User E → A: 4/6 ✅ SPILLOVER
      │   └─ User F → A: 5/6 ✅ SPILLOVER
      └─ User G (C's referral) → A: 6/6 ✅ SPILLOVER → COMPLETE!
```

### What Happens:
1. User A refers B and C directly (2/6 slots)
2. User C refers D, E, F, G
3. These referrals **spill over** into User A's matrix
4. User A's matrix fills to 6/6
5. User A automatically progresses to Bronze
6. User A earns $1.5 for each person (total $9)

## Matrix Completion Requirements

- **Feeder**: 6 people (2x2 matrix) → Bronze
- **Bronze**: 14 people (2x3 matrix) → Silver
- **Silver**: 14 people (2x3 matrix) → Gold
- **Gold**: 14 people (2x3 matrix) → Diamond
- **Diamond**: 14 people (2x3 matrix) → Infinity

## Commission Distribution

When a new user joins:
1. System finds available slot in matrix tree
2. Places user in first available position
3. Credits **all uplines** in the path:
   - Direct referrer gets commission
   - Referrer's upline gets commission
   - Continues up the chain
4. Each upline's `slots_filled` increments
5. Auto-progression triggers when matrix completes

## Database Tables Used

### `mlm_matrix`
- Tracks binary tree structure
- `left_child_id`, `right_child_id` for placement
- `parent_id` for upline tracking

### `stage_matrix`
- Tracks completion per stage
- `slots_filled` / `slots_required`
- `is_complete` triggers progression

### `referral_earnings`
- Records all commissions (direct + spillover)
- Links earner to new user

### `level_progressions`
- Logs stage upgrades
- Audit trail of progression

## Testing

To test spillover:
1. Create User A
2. User A refers User B and C
3. User C refers 4+ people
4. Check User A's matrix progress
5. Verify User A receives commissions from C's referrals
6. Confirm auto-progression when matrix completes

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/mlm/matrix-tree` - Get full matrix with spillover
- `GET /api/mlm/level-progress` - Check current stage progress
- `GET /api/mlm/earnings` - View all earnings (direct + spillover)
- `GET /api/mlm/team` - List all team members

## Frontend Features

- **Progress Bar**: Visual matrix completion indicator
- **Matrix Tree**: Shows full downline structure
- **Spillover Indicators**: Differentiates direct vs spillover referrals
- **Real-time Updates**: Matrix fills automatically with spillover

## Notes

- Spillover only works within the same stage
- Users must have paid joining fee for spillover to trigger
- Commissions are paid immediately on placement
- Auto-progression is instant when matrix completes
