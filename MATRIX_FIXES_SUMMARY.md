# Matrix Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Matrix Doesn't Automatically Show New Stage After Completion ✅

**Problem:**
- When a user's matrix was completed (6 slots for feeder, 14 slots for higher stages), the backend correctly upgraded the user to the next stage
- However, the frontend didn't automatically detect this change
- Users had to manually refresh the page to see their new stage

**Root Cause:**
- Frontend pages (Dashboard, Team, TeamTree) were only fetching data once on component mount
- No polling mechanism to detect stage changes in real-time

**Solution Applied:**
- Added auto-refresh interval (every 5 seconds) to all relevant pages:
  - `Dashboard.js`
  - `Team.js`
  - `TeamTree.js`
- Updated localStorage with latest profile data on each fetch
- Added stage change detection with congratulatory toast notification in TeamTree

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Dashboard.js`
- `src/pages/Team.js`
- `src/pages/TeamTree.js`

### 2. Can't View Referral Downlines in Matrix Structure ✅

**Problem:**
- The PyramidTree component only displayed direct referrals (first level)
- Users couldn't see their referrals' downlines (second, third levels, etc.)
- The component had expandable node logic but wasn't receiving the full tree data

**Root Cause:**
- TeamTree page was only passing `teamMembers` (direct referrals) to PyramidTree
- The backend has a `getMatrixTree()` endpoint that returns the full hierarchical tree
- This endpoint wasn't being called in the frontend

**Solution Applied:**
- Added `getMatrixTree()` API call to fetch full hierarchical matrix data
- Updated TeamTree to store and pass the complete matrix tree to PyramidTree
- PyramidTree now receives `matrixTree.children` which includes all downlines with their children

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/TeamTree.js`

## How It Works Now

### Auto-Refresh Mechanism
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
  // Auto-refresh every 5 seconds to detect stage changes
  const interval = setInterval(fetchData, 5000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

### Stage Change Detection
```javascript
// Check if stage changed
if (previousStage && previousStage !== profile.mlmLevel) {
  setShowToast(true); // Show congratulations message
  setTimeout(() => setShowToast(false), 5000);
}
```

### Full Matrix Tree Display
```javascript
const [profile, teamData, treeData] = await Promise.all([
  apiService.getProfile(),
  apiService.getTeam(),
  apiService.getMatrixTree().catch(() => null) // Fetch full tree
]);

// Pass tree data to PyramidTree
<PyramidTree 
  userStage={userProfile?.mlmLevel || 'no_stage'}
  teamMembers={matrixTree?.children || teamMembers} // Full tree with downlines
  matrixData={...}
/>
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Complete a matrix (6 slots for feeder/no_stage, 14 for higher stages)
- [ ] Verify stage automatically updates within 5 seconds
- [ ] Check that congratulations notification appears
- [ ] Navigate to Team Tree page
- [ ] Verify you can see direct referrals
- [ ] Click the expand button (+) on referrals who have downlines
- [ ] Verify downlines are visible with their information
- [ ] Check that all levels show correct stage badges

## Backend Logic (Already Working)

The backend was already correctly handling:
- Matrix completion detection in `checkLevelProgression()`
- Stage upgrades when qualified slots are filled
- Creating new stage_matrix entries for next stage
- Sending notifications about stage upgrades
- Building hierarchical matrix tree in `getFullMatrixTree()`

The issue was purely on the frontend not fetching/displaying this data properly.

## Deployment

Changes have been committed and pushed to main branch:
```
commit fcd54d4
Fix: Auto-refresh matrix on stage completion and show referral downlines
```

Render will automatically deploy these changes.
