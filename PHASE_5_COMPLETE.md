   - STAGE_EARNINGS constants (feeder: $1.5, bronze: $4.8, silver: $30, gold: $150, diamond: $750, infinity: $15,000)
   - calculateUserEarnings() - Sum total earnings from referral_earnings table
   - getEarningsByStage() - Group earnings by stage
   - processReferralEarning() - Create earning record, update wallet, create transaction
   - getStageProgress() - Return current stage info with slots filled/required

2. **backend/src/controllers/earningsController.js** ✅
   - getUserEarnings() - GET /api/earnings endpoint
   - getStageProgress() - GET /api/earnings/progress endpoint

3. **backend/src/routes/earnings.js** ✅
   - GET /api/earnings - Returns total earnings, earnings by stage, stage progress
   - GET /api/earnings/progress - Returns current stage progress details

4. **backend/src/server.js** ✅
   - Registered earnings routes at /api/earnings

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/earnings
Returns comprehensive earnings data for authenticated user:
```json
{
  "totalEarnings": 67.2,
  "earningsByStage": {
    "feeder": 9.0,
    "bronze": 28.8,
    "silver": 30.0
  },
  "stageProgress": {
    "currentStage": "silver",
    "slotsFilled": 1,
    "slotsRequired": 14,
    "isComplete": false
  }
}
```

### GET /api/earnings/progress
Returns current stage progress:
```json
{
  "currentStage": "silver",
  "slotsFilled": 1,
  "slotsRequired": 14,
  "isComplete": false,
  "completedAt": null
}
```

## Earnings Structure

| Stage    | Per Slot | Total Slots | Max Earnings |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Feeder   | $1.50    | 6           | $9.00        |
| Bronze   | $4.80    | 14          | $67.20       |
| Silver   | $30.00   | 14          | $420.00      |
| Gold     | $150.00  | 14          | $2,100.00    |
| Diamond  | $750.00  | 14          | $10,500.00   |
| Infinity | $15,000  | ∞           | Unlimited    |

## How It Works

1. **Earning Creation**: When a user is placed in someone's matrix, processReferralEarning() is called
2. **Wallet Update**: User's total_earned in wallets table is incremented
3. **Transaction Record**: A transaction record is created for audit trail
4. **Referral Earnings**: Record stored in referral_earnings table with stage and amount
5. **Progress Tracking**: stage_matrix table tracks slots_filled vs slots_required

## Integration Points

- **Matrix Service**: Calls earningsService.processReferralEarning() when placing users
- **Wallet System**: Earnings update total_earned (separate from deposit balance)
- **Transaction History**: All earnings create transaction records
- **Stage Progression**: Earnings tied to stage completion

## Testing

Test earnings calculation:
```bash
# Get user earnings
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:5000/api/earnings

# Get stage progress
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:5000/api/earnings/progress
```

## Next Steps

**Phase 6**: Admin Panel for Earnings Management
- View all user earnings
- Earnings reports by stage
- Export earnings data
- Earnings analytics dashboard

**Phase 7**: Testing & Validation
- Unit tests for earnings calculations
- Integration tests for matrix + earnings
- Edge case testing (stage transitions, multiple earnings)

**Phase 8**: Deployment
- Deploy earnings system to production
- Monitor earnings calculations
- Set up alerts for anomalies
